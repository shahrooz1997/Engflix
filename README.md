# Engflix
This is a great application that helps you learn English in the most efficient way, through movies.
This breaks down a movie to the parts based on the subtitle, and pause after showing each part, so you can practice by speaking what you heard.

## Controls

w: play/pause

a: move the previous subtitle

s: repeat the current subtitle

d: go to next subtile by palying the movie

f: fast-forward to the next subtitle (Please note that pressing f will seek the player to the start of the next subtitle while pressing d will not.)

q: sync the application if you seek the player manually

## Todo

* Adding recording of your voice after it shows you a subtitle

* Play back your recorded voice on the silent movie (I am think of maybe changing the paly rate to match it with your speed of speaking)

* Adding bookmart feature so you can save your favorite idioms

* Using Leitner system to help you remember the bookmarked idioms
